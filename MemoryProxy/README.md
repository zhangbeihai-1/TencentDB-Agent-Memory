# MemoryProxy

MemoryProxy is a **transparent LLM request proxy**: instead of having a coding agent (Claude Code / CodeBuddy / ...) talk to the LLM directly, requests are routed through the proxy first. Around each forward it automatically runs session initialization, memory injection, conversation write-back and more, so an agent can tap into the team memory, Skills and Knowledge provided by [MemoryCore](../MemoryCore/README.md) **without changing a single line of code**.

It is "transparent" to both the client and the upstream model — it changes no protocol and forwards OpenAI `/v1/chat/completions` and Anthropic `/v1/messages` verbatim. It just does a few extra things on the way in and out: **session initialization, context injection, conversation write-back, authentication and usage reporting**.

> In one line: MemoryProxy handles "access & forwarding"; MemoryCore handles "storage & processing" of memory. The proxy itself persists no memory data — all Memory / Skill / Knowledge reads and writes go through the MemoryCore Gateway (default `:8420`). For the overall product positioning, see the repo root [README.md](../README.md).

```

## Core capabilities

- **Session initialization**: intercepts the first request and guides the user through an interactive form to pick team → agent → task, then injects the agent/task context into the system prompt. Supports auto pre-selection from request headers (`x-team-id` / `x-agent-id` / `x-task-id`).
- **Context injection**: injects Skills, Knowledge and Memory L2/L3 into the system prompt on demand; L0/L1 are exposed as read-only tools for the model to query proactively, avoiding upstream KV-cache invalidation.
- **Conversation write-back (extraction)**: at the end of each human turn, sends the conversation slice to MemoryCore `/v3/skill/conversation/add` (Skill archival) and writes L0 short-term memory for background extraction on the core side.
- **Auth & identity**: calls MemoryCore `POST /v3/meta/auth/verify` to validate `x-tdai-user-key` and resolve `user_id` as the end-to-end user identity; `spaceId` (memory instance id) is auto-extracted from the `/proxy/<spaceId>/...` path.
- **System-user passthrough**: internal service accounts (e.g. memory / wiki internal calls) short-circuit session init and injection on match, doing pure passthrough + billing only.
- **Skill Bridge / Memory Bridge**: reverse-proxies MemoryCore's skill / memory HTTP tools, injecting `serviceToken` on forward so credentials never appear in an LLM-visible prompt.
- **Unified storage abstraction (ProxyStorage)**: session init state, injection cache and Skill state (`inj:*` / `sk:*` / `vpin:*`) support five backends — Redis, COS (kernel-sts), SQLite, FS, Memory. COS is preferred for multi-node deployments.
- **Input TPM / QPM rate limiting**: 60-second sliding-window limiting on Redis, keyed by `spaceId × final model`, adjustable at runtime via `/v3/admin/rate-limits`.
- **Observability & usage reporting**: three independent channels — Opik trace, Langfuse (one trace = one turn), ClickHouse (per-turn token detail). Any one failing does not affect the business path.
- **Credit billing report**: after each upstream response completes, computes CreditDelta from the pricing table and reports it to the billing service; only requests whose path carries `/proxy/<spaceId>/` are counted.
- **Multi-node deployment**: scales horizontally with an external gateway plus the COS backend; the `/skill-bridge` and `/memory-bridge` prefixes are passed through verbatim from the gateway to proxy instances.

## Request pipeline

A main-model call carrying `spaceId` roughly goes through these stages:

```text
POST /proxy/<spaceId>/v1/chat/completions | /v1/messages
   │
   ├─ 1. auth ─────── validate x-tdai-user-key, resolve user_id
   ├─ 2. systemUser ─ short-circuit passthrough on internal-account match
   ├─ 3. sessionInit ─ first turn shows a form: team → agent → task
   ├─ 4. injection ── inject skill / knowledge / memory into system prompt
   ├─ 5. rateLimit ── spaceId × final-model TPM/QPM limiting
   ├─ 6. forward ──── forward to the upstream LLM
   ├─ 7. extract ──── async write-back of conversation + L0 after the turn
   └─ 8. report ───── ClickHouse / Langfuse / Opik / Credit reporting
```

## Memory layers & injection strategy

MemoryProxy mirrors MemoryCore's four-layer memory structure, plugging into the prompt via two modes — "inject" and "toolize":

| Layer | Role | How it plugs in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| L0 | Short-term conversation memory | proxy writes it back to MemoryCore each turn |
| L1 | Session-level key memory | recalled on demand by the model via the `<tdai_memory_tools>` tools |
| L2 | Agent Profile | injected directly into the system prompt |
| L3 | Team / Global memory | injected directly into the system prompt |

Skills and Knowledge follow the same idea:

- `<cloud_skills>` — summaries of relevant Skills retrieved from MemoryCore RAG
- `<skill_tools>` — a block telling the model how to call Skills via curl (read/write permission controlled by `skillRuntime.allowLlmWrite`)
- `<knowledge_tools>` — two-step self-discovery tools for team knowledge resources (Wiki / CodeGraph)
- `<session_context>` — agent/task info appended every turn after session init completes

## Requirements

- Node.js `v22.x` (checked strictly at startup; `>= 22.16.0` recommended)
- npm or pnpm
- A running **MemoryCore Gateway** (default `:8420`) providing Auth / Skill / Meta / Memory APIs
- Redis (default backing store for session/injection/Skill state; switchable once `storage.enabled=true`)
- An OpenAI-compatible upstream LLM API (TokenHub or others)

## Quick start

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd MemoryProxy
npm install
```

### 2. Create the config

Create your own `config.yaml` from the example:

```bash
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
# adjust upstream / auth / tdai / skill / storage as needed
```

At minimum confirm:

- `upstream.url` / `upstream.apiKey` — upstream LLM address and credentials
- `auth.url` / `tdai.endpoint` / `skill.endpoint` — point to your MemoryCore Gateway (default `http://127.0.0.1:8420`)

> **Run locally without Redis**: the example config defaults to `redis.enabled: true`, which spams `ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:6379` when no Redis is running locally. For pure local development, set `redis.enabled: false` + `storage.enabled: true` (`storage.backend: sqlite`); session/injection/Skill state then goes to local SQLite and the process starts up cleanly.

### 3. Start the service

```bash
npm run start:config
# equivalent to:
node --import tsx/esm src/index.ts --config config.yaml
```

### 4. Health check

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8096/health
```

Sample response (`storage.effective` is the observability anchor for the storage backend):

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "upstream": "https://tokenhub.example.com/v1",
  "storage": { "enabled": false, "requested": "sqlite", "effective": "sqlite", "degraded": false }
}
```

## Ways to start

```bash
# Direct start (built-in defaults, not for production)
npm start

# With a config file
npm run start:config

# CLI overrides (highest priority)
node --import tsx/esm src/index.ts --port 9000 --upstream https://other.api/v1

# Dev mode (auto-restart on file change)
npm run dev:config
```

### Background script `proxy.sh`

Always uses `./config.yaml`, auto-detects the `node` path (nvm / fnm compatible), and writes logs by date to `logs/YYYY-MM-DD.log`.

```bash
./proxy.sh start          # start in background
./proxy.sh stop           # stop
./proxy.sh restart        # restart
./proxy.sh status         # status (includes /health output)
./proxy.sh log            # tail today's log

./proxy.sh daemon         # daemon mode (auto-restart on crash)
./proxy.sh daemon-stop
./proxy.sh daemon-status
```

## Client configuration

Point the coding agent's upstream address at this proxy and keep the rest (`apiKey`, `model`, ...) unchanged. Include `spaceId` (memory instance id) in the path — the proxy auto-extracts it for auth, injection and billing.

OpenAI-compatible client:

```json
{
  "apiKey": "sk-mem-xxx",
  "url": "http://localhost:8096/proxy/<spaceId>/v1/chat/completions"
}
```

Anthropic Messages client:

```json
{
  "apiKey": "sk-mem-xxx",
  "url": "http://localhost:8096/proxy/<spaceId>/v1/messages"
}
```

## FAQ

### Is an API key mandatory?

Starting the proxy itself needs **no** API key. A user key (`x-tdai-user-key` / the client `Authorization` header) only gates individual requests, and only when `auth.enabled=true`:

- The code default is `auth.enabled: false`, while `config.example.yaml` sets it to `true`. For pure local development you may set `auth.enabled: false`: requests then pass without any key and the user identity falls back to `anonymous` (the system-user short-circuit needs a verified `user_id`, so it simply never matches).
- With `auth.enabled=true`, a missing or invalid key is rejected with `401 Authentication failed` before the body is parsed. Keep it on when listening on non-loopback addresses or deploying multi-node.
- Independently of user auth, an **upstream LLM credential** is still required at forward time: set `upstream.apiKey` (or a per-agent `upstream.agents[<agent>].apiKey`) in `config.yaml`, or leave it empty to pass the client's own key through unchanged.

### Can the local Codex CLI be used to start the proxy?

No. MemoryProxy is a standalone Node.js process — start it with `npm run start:config` (or `./proxy.sh start` / Docker). There is no Codex-CLI-based startup path: the proxy never shells out to any agent CLI, and startup is identical regardless of which coding agent connects later.

Codex appears only as an agent-name routing boundary on an already-running proxy: the commented `codex` entry under `upstream.agents` in [config.example.yaml](./config.example.yaml) routes requests whose URL starts with the `/codex` prefix to a dedicated upstream, and because it declares no `apiKey`, the client's own key is forwarded (client-key passthrough instead of the global `upstream.apiKey` fallback). Configuring the Codex CLI itself — base URL, provider, key — happens on the Codex side and is outside this repository.

## Main HTTP endpoints

| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/proxy/<spaceId>/v1/chat/completions` | OpenAI-compatible main-model call (with memory instance id) |
| `POST` | `/proxy/<spaceId>/v1/messages` | Anthropic Messages main-model call |
| `POST` | `/v1/messages` | Anthropic Messages API (fallback without spaceId) |
| `POST` | `/*` | OpenAI-compatible chat endpoint (catch-all) |
| `ALL`  | `/skill-bridge/**` | reverse-proxy for MemoryCore skill HTTP tools |
| `ALL`  | `/memory-bridge/**` | reverse-proxy for MemoryCore memory HTTP tools |
| `POST` | `/v3/instance/proxy-destroy` | ops endpoint: clear COS cache on instance destroy |
| `GET/PUT/DELETE` | `/v3/admin/rate-limits` | query / modify per-instance × model TPM/QPM |
| `GET`  | `/health` | runtime health check (includes `storage.effective`) |
| `GET`  | `/whoami` | API Key → keyId (plain text, handy with curl) |

## Configuration

See the fully-commented [`config.example.yaml`](./config.example.yaml). Precedence: **CLI args > YAML config file > built-in defaults**.

Config sections at a glance:

| Section | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `server` | listen host / port, upstream forward timeout |
| `upstream` | default upstream URL and global `apiKey` (replaces forward auth when non-empty) |
| `log` | log directory, level, backend and rotation policy |
| `redis` | default backend for session / injection / Skill state (used when `storage.enabled` is off) |
| `storage` | unified storage abstraction (`cos` / `sqlite` / `fs` / `memory`); `cos` preferred for multi-node |
| `auth` | `x-tdai-user-key` → `user_id` validation (calls MemoryCore `/v3/meta/auth/verify`) |
| `admin` | shared secret for ops endpoints (e.g. `/v3/instance/proxy-destroy`) |
| `systemUsers` | internal service accounts; short-circuit passthrough on match |
| `injection` | master switch and injector list (`skill` / `knowledge` / `tdai-memory`) |
| `extraction` | conversation write-back master switch (skill archival + L0 write) |
| `sessionInit` | session init form flow and header auto pre-select policy |
| `tdai` | MemoryCore connection and L0/L1/L2/L3 switches |
| `skill` | MemoryCore data-plane config (Skill RAG, Skill archival, Meta) |
| `knowledge` | standalone knowledge gateway (may differ from skill) |
| `skillRuntime` | whether the main model may write Skills (read-only by default) |
| `rateLimit` | Input TPM / QPM limiting per memory instance × actual model |
| `clickhouse` | per-turn usage reporting (billing data source) |
| `creditReport` / `creditPricing` | Credit billing report and pricing table |
| `upstream.agents` | override upstream URL + apiKey per agent name (e.g. route `claude-code` through CCR) |

> `injection`, `extraction`, `sessionInit`, `tdai`, `skill`, `knowledge`, `skillRuntime` are the memory-related sections — focus on them first when integrating.

### Common environment variables

```bash
TDAI_MEMORY_SYSTEM_USER_ID   # user_id of the memory internal service account
TDAI_MEMORY_SYSTEM_USER_KEY  # apiKey of the memory internal service account (ops reference only)
TDAI_PROXY_ADMIN_API_KEY     # shared secret for ops endpoint auth
PROXY_DB_PATH                # sqlite backend db path (used when storage.sqlite.dbPath is empty)
```

## Choosing a storage backend

With `storage.enabled=true`, all session/injection/Skill state (`inj:*` / `sk:*` / `vpin:*`) goes through ProxyStorage:

| Backend | Use case | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cos` | Production multi-node | cross-node sharing; kernel-sts only (one temp credential per spaceId) |
| `sqlite` | Single-instance local dev / CI | built-in sweeper periodically clears the `ttl/` bucket; `nottl/` is kept forever |
| `fs` | Offline / docker fallback | no sweeper; delegate to external tmpwatch |
| `memory` | Fallback / testing | cleared on process restart |

The key layout is uniformly `proxy_cache/{ttl|nottl}/{spaceId}/{userId}/{agentSource}/{sessionId}/...`; `ttl/` holds hot cache (rebuildable), `nottl/` holds business state such as bindings that must persist.

Degradation chain: `cos → sqlite → fs → memory`. If any backend fails to init, it degrades automatically, and the `/health` endpoint exposes `storage.effective` as the observability anchor.

## Docker

The image runs TypeScript directly via tsx, uses `tini` as PID 1, runs as a non-root user, and ships a `/health` `HEALTHCHECK`. The multi-stage build requires BuildKit.

Build in the `MemoryProxy/` directory:

```bash
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -t memory-proxy:local .
```

Run the container (config provided by mounting `/data/config.yaml`; sqlite storage persisted to `/data/tdai-memory-proxy`):

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -p 8096:8096 \
  -v "$PWD/config.yaml:/data/config.yaml:ro" \
  -v tdai-proxy-data:/data/tdai-memory-proxy \
  -e TDAI_PROXY_ADMIN_API_KEY="replace-with-a-strong-random-token" \
  memory-proxy:local
```

- The default config path is `/data/config.yaml`; override it by appending `--config /other/path.yaml` to `docker run`.
- Inject credentials via environment variables or a Secret Manager; never bake API keys / STS credentials into the image or config repo.
- Health status: `docker inspect --format '{{.State.Health.Status}}' <container>`.

## Running tests

```bash
npm test              # vitest run (unit + integration by default)
npm run test:watch
```

`__tests__/` live under each submodule: `session/__tests__` (session flow), `skill/__tests__` (archival trigger, version pin), `storage/__tests__` (backend contracts), `db/__tests__` (repo consistency), etc. `docs/` also provides several end-to-end runbooks (`e2e-runbook.md` / `e2e-full-coverage-runbook.md`, ...) for verifying the memory pipeline against a real MemoryCore + Redis + storage backend.

## Security & release notes

- When listening on a non-loopback address or deploying multi-node, enable `auth.enabled=true` and inject `TDAI_PROXY_ADMIN_API_KEY` via env to protect ops endpoints.
- Inject all secrets via environment variables or a Secret Manager; never commit real `apiKey` / `serviceToken` / STS credentials / billing URLs into the config repo.
- For multi-node deployments you must use `storage.backend=cos` and explicitly set `injection.externalGatewayUrl`, otherwise each instance caches independently and causes upstream KV-cache misses.
- Do not commit generated data, local databases, logs or env files (`logs/`, `*.db`, `.env`, `dump.rdb`, `session*.json`, `*.pid`, ...).
