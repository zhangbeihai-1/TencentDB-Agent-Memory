/**
 * extraction-gate — the single semantic gate for every write-side
 * (extraction) call site.
 *
 * Motivation:
 *   The read side (injection) has a first-class pipeline + hook registry +
 *   yaml whitelist (`injection.injectors: [...]`). The write side
 *   historically had none — `triggerSkillExtractIfReady` and
 *   `recordTdaiTurn` were sprinkled across handler.ts / anthropicHandler.ts
 *   and had no top-level kill switch. Operators could not "inject but not
 *   extract" without touching source dependencies.
 *
 * Design (intentionally minimal — keep the stable version stable):
 *   - Add ONE yaml section: `extraction: { enabled, extractors: [...] }`.
 *   - Add ONE pure predicate: `isExtractionAllowed(config, asset)`.
 *   - Wrap each existing call site in `if (isExtractionAllowed(...))`.
 *
 * Backwards compatibility is preserved by making the gate PERMISSIVE when
 * the config section is missing or malformed:
 *   - `config.extraction` absent          → allow all (defensive fallback)
 *   - `extractors` field missing          → allow all (partial config)
 *   - `extractors` not an array           → allow all (yaml typo tolerance)
 *   - `enabled: false`                    → deny everything
 *   - `extractors: []`                    → deny everything
 *   - `extractors: ["skill"]`             → allow only "skill"
 *
 * Adding a new extractor asset later means: register it under a stable name
 * here and add one `if (isExtractionAllowed(config, "your-asset"))` at the
 * new call site. No pipeline refactor required.
