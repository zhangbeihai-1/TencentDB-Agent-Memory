/**
 * Request-Preparation Adapter — the host's second (and last) bridge to the
 * optional private extension package, sibling to `guard-adapter.ts`.
 *
 * `guard-adapter.ts` owns the *routing* half of the extension: deciding where a
 * request goes. This file owns the *request-preparation* half: an optional
 * stage that runs immediately before the upstream request body is built, and
 * which may rewrite that body (and its message array) in place.
 *
 * The host is deliberately opaque to what the rewriting actually does. It hands
 * the extension one untouched slice of the opaque `costGuard.options` payload
 * plus the transport context of the pending upstream call, and gets back a
 * result it never interprets — only a flat scalar projection of it is forwarded
 * to the observability sinks. No stage semantics, thresholds, heuristics, or
 * algorithm names live in this repo; they are owned entirely by the extension.
 *
 * That opacity is the point: this package is published, the extension is not.
 *
 * ### Configuration
 *
 * Nothing new is parsed by the host. `parseCostGuard()` already folds every
 * unrecognized key under the YAML `costGuard:` block into `costGuard.options`
 * verbatim, so the stage is configured by adding one key there:
 *
 * ```yaml
 * costGuard:
 *   requestPrepare:      # opaque — shape is owned by the private extension
 *     enabled: true
 *     ...
 * ```
 *
 * Absent that key the stage is dormant and every export here is a no-op. It
 * shares the `costGuard:` block for lack of a better home, but not the
 * `costGuard.enabled` switch: that one governs routing, and the two are
 * independently useful.
 *
 * ### Graceful degradation
 *
 * The extension is an optional peer dependency, so it is simply missing in most
 * builds. Every export tolerates that, tolerates an extension too old to expose
 * a given entry point, and tolerates the stage throwing: the request forwards
 * unchanged rather than failing. Preparation is an optimization, never a
 * correctness requirement.
